# Using the OpenCV Template Application

OpenCV \(Open Source Computer Vision Library\) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer. The library is cross-platform. It focuses mainly on real-time image processing. If the library finds Intel's integrated Performance Primitives on the system, it will use these proprietary optimized routines to accelerate itself. SDK provides a facility to develop OpenCV application as part of this it provides a template application \(which reverses an image\). User can create his own applications. SDK also provides all the required openCV libraries with SDK install \(<OpenCV install path\>\\SDK\\<Release\>\\sw\\ThirdParty\\opencv\) and template application is having all openCV path set for building the template application. SDK supports only for Linux OS only. It supports only for ARM processor.
