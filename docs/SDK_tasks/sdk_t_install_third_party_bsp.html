# Importing Third-Party Software Components

Third-party software components and board support packages \(BSPs\) typically need to be installed \(copied\) into a software repository of your choice.

For example, assume that you want to install a custom board support package called my\_sw\_platform\_v1\_00\_a, and that your software repository is located in `/home/sdk/sw_repos/dvi_demo_repository.`

In this case, you create a library directory under your repository directory, such as `/home/sdk/sw_repos/dvi_demo_repository/demo_library.`

You then paste your custom board support package files into `/home/sdk/sw_repos/dvi_demo_repository/demo_library/bsp /my_sw_platform_v1_00_a.` For information on how software repositories must be structured, refer to [Repositories](../SDK_concepts/sdk_c_repos.html).

Finally, you must configure your SDK workspace to recognize the new repository. To do this, add the path to the library `/home/sdk/sw_repos/dvi_demo_repository/demo_library` to the Software Repositories list maintained by SDK for your workspace.

For information about adding repositories to your workspace, refer to Setting up software repositories.
