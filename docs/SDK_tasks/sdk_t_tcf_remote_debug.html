# Using a Remote Host with System Debugger

1.   Setting Up the Remote System Environment 
    1.  Running hw\_server with non-default port \(for example: 3122\) enables remote connections. Use the following command to launch hw\_server on port 3122: 

        ```
            hw_server -s TCP::3122
        ```

    2.  Make sure your board is correctly connected.
    3.  In a cmd window of the host machine, check the IP Address: ![](../images/remote_sys_ip.png)


2.   Setting Up the Local System for Remote Debug 
    1.  Launch SDK.
    2.  Select the application to debug remotely.
    3.  Select **Run \> Debug Configurations**.
    4.   Create a new system debugger configuration. 
    5.  In the Target Setup tab, click **New** to create a new target connection. ![](../images/sdk_t_tcf_remote_debug-1.png)

 
    6.  In the New Target Connection dialog box, add the required details for the remote host that is connected to the target.
    7.  **Target Name:** Type a name for the target.
    8.  **Host:** IP address or name of the host machine.
    9.  **Port:** Port on which the hardware server was launched, such as 3121. ![](../images/sdk_t_tcf_remote_debug-2.png)


    10.  Select **Use Symbol Server** to ensure that the source code view is available, during debugging the application remotely. Symbol server acts as a mediator between hardware server and SDK. 
    11. Click **OK.**
    12. Now you can see that there are two available connections. In this case, **remote\_zc702\_1** is the remote connection. ![](../images/sdk_t_tcf_remote_debug-3.png)

 
    13. Select or add the remaining debug configuration details and click **Debug.** ![](../images/sdk_t_tcf_remote_debug-4.png)
