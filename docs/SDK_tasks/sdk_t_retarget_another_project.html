# Re-Targeting a Software Project

To re-target your software project:

SDK lists the BSP projects available in the workspace.

1.   Right-click the application project in the Project Explorer view and select **Change Referenced BSP**. 
2.   SDK lists the BSP projects available in the workspace. Select the project to re-target.

3.   Click **OK**. SDK re-targets your application project to the new BSP project and the new hardware project and starts re-building the project.
