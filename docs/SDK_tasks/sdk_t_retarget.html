# Re-Targeting A BSP for a New Hardware Platform

The SDK workspace supports multiple hardware projects and multiple BSPs per hardware project. A single software project can be portable across these hardware platforms and board support platforms. At any given time, the software BSP project and the software applications associated to that BSP project are targeted \(or referenced\) to a single hardware project. Therefore, running or debugging a software project on another hardware project, you must re-target your software BSP project to another hardware project.

To re-target your software project to another hardware project:

1.   Right-click the software BSP project that your software application currently references. 
2.   Select **Properties.** 
3.   Select **Project References.** 
4.   Uncheck the reference to the current hardware project and select the hardware project which you would like to re-target. 
5.   Click **OK.** SDK re-targets your BSP project and application project to the new hardware project and starts rebuilding the projects.

    Alternately, if you have two BSP projects each targeting a different hardware project, you can re-target your software application to run or debug on a different hardware project by changing the BSP reference accordingly.
