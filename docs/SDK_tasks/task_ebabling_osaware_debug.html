# Enabling OS Aware Debug

This section describes setting up OS aware debug for a Zynq board running Linux from SD card, using the SDK IDE. It is assumed that users are aware of setting up a Jtag connection to the board, building Linux kernel and booting it from SD card. For details on how to set up the kernel debug, refer [Attach and Debug using Xilinx System Debugger](sdk_t_tcf_attach_debug_linux_kernel_tcf.html).

1.   Compile the kernel source using the following configuration options: 

    ```
    CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y
    CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
    ```

2.   Launch SDK. 
3.   Click **Window \> Open Perspective \> Debug**. 
4.   Click **Run \> Debug Configurations**. 
5.   In the Debug Configurations dialog box, select **Xilinx C/C++ application**and click the **New** button \(![](../images/new_icon.png)\). 
6.   Click **Debug** 
7.   Debugging begins, with the processors in the running state. 
8.   Select the **Enable Linux OS Awareness** option from the **Debug** view in the processor context.

9.   You can also perform the following actions from the menu that appears. 
    -   **Refresh OSA Processes**: Select this option to refresh the list of running processes.
    -   **Auto refresh on exec**: When selected, all the running processes are refreshed and seen in the **Debug** view. When not selected, new processes are not visible in the debug view.
    -   **Auto refresh on suspend**: When selected, all the processes will be re-synced whenever the processor suspends. When not selected, only the current process is re-synced.
    -   **Linux OSA File Selection**: Select this option to change the symbol file.
10.  Alternatively, OS aware debugging can also be enabled using the -osa command in the Xilinx System Debugger \(XSDB\) command-line console. 

    ```
    osa -file <symbol-file> -fast-step -fast-exec
    ```
