# Dump/Restore Memory

The SDK Memory window does not have the ability to load or dump memory contents from or to a file.

You can use the **Dump/Restore Memory** function to copy the memory file contents to a data file and restore data file contents back to memory. To do this:

1.  Launch the hardware server, if it is not already running.
2.  Select **Xilinx Tools \> Dump/Restore Memory.**
3.  The Dump/Restore Memory dialog box opens.

4.  Click **Select** to select a Processor from the Select Peer and Context window. SDK creates peers based on available target connections. For this example, SDK creates a Peer named Zc706\_remote.

5.  Select the peer corresponding to your Target connection from the **Peers** list \(in this case, Zc706\_remote\), and then select the related processor, **ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore \#0,** from the APU Context. **Note:** Select the processor context, not the device context. In the example here, the processor context is **APU**.
6.  Click **OK** to select the processor.
7.  Set the location of the data file to restore from or dump to.
8.  Select either the **Restore Memory** or **Dump Memory** option button.
9.  In the **Start** field, specify the starting memory address from which you want to dump or restore memory.
10. In the Size \(in bytes\) field, specify the number of bytes to be dumped or restored.
11. Click **OK.**SDK dumps or restores data from the starting address specified.
