# Generating a Board Support Package for External Tools

Generating a board support package \(BSP\) for use with external tools involves generating all the components constituting the BSP.

To build a BSP project, right-click the project and select **Build Project** or **Refresh Project** \(these options appear only if the **Build Automatically** option is NOT set\). You can also select **Project \> Build Project.**

You can set an option to have SDK automatically initiate a build when you create or change your BSP project. To set this option, select **Project \> Build Automatically.** With this option, SDK uses Libgen to automatically build the project. At the end of the build process, the necessary header and library files are generated within the board support package directory.
