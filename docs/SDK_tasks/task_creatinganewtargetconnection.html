# Creating a New Target Connection

You can configure the remote target details by adding a new connection in the Target Connections view.

To create new target connection:

1.  In the Target Connections window of the SDK interface, click the **Add Target Connection** button.![](../images/sdk_t_target_connections-2.png)

3.  In the **Target Name** field, type a name for the new remote connection.
4.  Check the **Set as default target** checkbox to set this target as default. SDK uses the default target for all the future interactions with the board.
5.  In the **Host** field, type the name or IP address of the remote host machine. This is the machine that is connected to the target and hw\_server is running.
6.  In the **Port** field, type the port number on which hw\_server is running. By default, hw\_server runs on port 3121.
7.   Select **Use Symbol Server**, if the hardware server is running on a remote host. 
8.   Click **OK** to create a new target connection.
