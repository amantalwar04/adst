To view a board support package in the MSS Viewer, do the following:

1.  Using the Project Explorer in the C/C++ Perspective, select a BSP project.
2.  Click on the arrow to the left of the BSP name to expand the project tree.
3.  Locate and double-click the MSS file. The MSS Viewer opens.
4.   Click the **Overview** tab \(located on the bottom of the page\). Information is shown for the Standalone BSP, which supports application development within SDK.
