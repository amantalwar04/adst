# Selecting a Run Configuration

You can reuse a previously created run configuration to run your program on target.

To select a run configuration:

1.  Select **Run \> Run Configurations.**
2.  Select an existing run configuration from the Configurations list.
3.  Click **Run.**
4.  SDK downloads and executes the program on the target. You can view the progress messages on the SDK Console.
5.  To view the program output, use the STDIO Connection tab to use SDK console.
6.  The software program stops upon completion, such as when it reaches the **exit \(\)** function. If you want to stop the program execution prior to completion, type the command **stop** on the XSCT console.
