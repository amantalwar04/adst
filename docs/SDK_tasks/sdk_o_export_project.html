# Exporting Software Projects

You can export an existing SDK software project and software resources, such as source and header files, from your workspace. Xilinx recommends exporting the application, its board support package project and the underlying hardware project files so that your project can be safely imported back into another workspace.

**Note:** If your software projects depend on external files such as custom drivers or libraries, they should also be available when the projects are imported to another workspace.

You can export projects from your workspace in the following ways:

-   [Exporting Resources to the File System](sdk_t_export_file.html#)
-   [Exporting Resources to an Archive File](sdk_t_export_archive.html#)

-   **[Exporting Resources to the File System](../SDK_tasks/sdk_t_export_file.html)**
