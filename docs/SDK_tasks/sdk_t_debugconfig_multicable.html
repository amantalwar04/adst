# Debug Configuration using System Debugger

To select the cable-type and device, connected to the host, using the **Debug Configurations** dialog box, do the following:

1.   Select an application in the **Project Explorer** view.. 
2.   Select **Run \> Debug configurations**. The **Debug Configurations** dialog box appears. ![](../images/sdk_t_debugconfig_multcable.png) 
3.   If a board is connected, with the host through one cable, then click **Debug**. Alternatively, if more than one cable is connected to the host, you must explicitly select the device. Click **Select**. The **Select the device** dialog box appears

    **Note:** To debug both PS and PL applications, it is mandatory to select both the FPGA device and the PS device. The selection of FPGA device in debug configuration may be ignored, when it is already configured using the**Program FPGA**wizard.
