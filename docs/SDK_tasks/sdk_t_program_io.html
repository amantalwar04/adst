# Program Input and Output

If the software program input/output is set to use a serial interface, you can redirect input and output to your console, use the terminal plugin program included with SDK, or use any program such as hyperterminal or teraterm to view the program output.

To connect input and output to your console, click to select the **Connect process input & output to a terminal** check box in your run or debug configuration. For more information, refer to [Creating a Run Configuration](sdk_t_new_run_config.html#).

To use the terminal plugin program included with SDK, select **Window \> Show View \> Terminal** and click **OK.** A terminal view appears in your workspace and you can configure its settings.
