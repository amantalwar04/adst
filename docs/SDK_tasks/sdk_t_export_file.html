# Exporting Resources to the File System

There are two ways in which you can use the **Export** wizard to export resources from the Workspace to the file system.

1.   In the **Project Explorer**, select the resources that you want to export. 
2.   Select **File \> Export**. The **Export** wizard opens. 
3.   Select **General \> File system** and click **Next.**By default, SDK exports the selected resources along with their children. You can modify the set of resources to export by selecting them in the **File System** pane. Select items individually, or use the **Select All** and **Deselect All** buttons. You can filter the file types using the **Filter Types** button. 
4.   Specify the export file path and the name of the directory in the **To directory** field. 

    **Note:** You can also export folders and files by dragging them from one of the navigation views to the file system and dropping them in the file system, or by copying and pasting them.
