# Exporting a Hardware Specification in Vivado

To export the hardware specification required for SDK, do the following in Vivado® IP integrator:

1.  In Vivado, select **File \> Export \> Export Hardware**.
2.   In the **Export Hardware** dialog box, you can choose to select the Include bitstream check box. When you select this option, IP integrator exports hardware platform information, including a bitstream .bit file containing your hardware design for download to the board. The bitstream is generated by running the Vivado® implementation tools, which might take few minutes to many hours depending on the complexity of your design. 

    **Note:** You can export without selecting this option, if the hardware platform information exists and bitstream generation is not required.

3.  In the **Export to** field, specify the directory into which IP integrator will place the exported files.
4.  Click **OK** to generate hardware platform information to be used by SDK when developing software applications.
5.   Select **File \> Launch SDK**. The **Launch SDK** dialog box appears. 
6.   In the **Exported location** field, specify the location of the exported hardware. Default is **Local to project**. 
7.   In the **Workspace** field, specify the SDK workspace location. Default is **Local to project**. 
8.   Click **OK** to launch the SDK with the specified hardware and workspace locations.
