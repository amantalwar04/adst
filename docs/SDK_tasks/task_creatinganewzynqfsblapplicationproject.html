2.   In the **Project Name** field, type a name for the new project. 
3.   Select the location for the project. To use the default location as displayed in the **Location** field, leave the **Use default location** check box selected. Otherwise, click to unselect the check box, then type or browse to the directory location. 

    The **Hardware Platform** drop-down list comes with pre-defined hardware platforms for ZC702 , ZC706 & ZED hardware.

7.   Select the **Create New** option from the list to create a new hardware platform project. 
8.   From the **Processor** drop-down lists, select the appropriate target processor. 
9.   Select the options for the target software: 
10.  Select the appropriate Language option. For this example, select **C/C++.**
