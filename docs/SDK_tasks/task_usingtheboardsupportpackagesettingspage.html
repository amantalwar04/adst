# Using the Board Support Package Settings Page

The **Board Support Package** settings page enables you toconfigure parameters of the OS and its constituent libraries.

**Note:** Options for only the libraries that you enabled in the **Overview** page will be visible. Options for the OS/standalone supported peripherals, that are present in the hardware platform, are also shown on the page.
