# Establishing a Target Connection

To establish a target connection, you can use either the local board or the remote board. By default, the local target connection is selected in the **Target Connections** view. You can confirm connections to the local board by checking the local connection.

To use a remote board to establish a target connection:

1.   Ensure that the target is connected to the remote host. 
2.   Launch hw\_server manually on the remote host: 
    1.   Take a shell on the remote host. 
    2.   Source the setup scripts. C:/Xilinx/SDK/<version\>/settings64.bat \(or\) /opt/Xilinx/SDK/2015.1<version\>/settings64.csh 
3.  Run the hw\_server on the machine that connects to the board. 

    **Note:** Ensure that the target \(board\) is connected to the remote host.

4.  Select the port number and the hostname to create a target connection to the host running the hw\_server.
5.  Right-click the newly created target connection and select **Set As Default.**
