# Importing a Trace Package

The **Import Trace Package**wizard allows users select a previously exported trace package from their media and import the content of the package in the workspace.

The Traces folder holds the set of traces available for a tracing project. To import a trace package to the Traces folder of a project:

1.   Select **File** \> **Import** from the **File** main menu. The **Import** dialog box appears.
2.   Expand **Tracing** and select **Trace Package Import**. 
3.   Click **Next**. The **Import trace package** dialog box appears.
4.   Select the archive containing the traces and the destination project. 
5.   You can also open the **Import trace package**wizard by expanding the project, in the **Project Explorer** view, and selecting the **Import Trace Package** from the context menu that appears.
