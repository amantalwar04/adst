# Debug after re-launch does not stop on breakpoints.

SDK does a processor reset on every debug session. The interrupt controller is not reset during processor reset. Change the reset type to **System Reset** in the **Target Setup** tab page of the **Debug configuration** dialog box.

This is applicable only if you terminate a debug session while the processor is in interrupt context.
