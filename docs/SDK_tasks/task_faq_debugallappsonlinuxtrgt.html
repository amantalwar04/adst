# I want to debug all the applications that are running on my Linux target. How can I achieve it?

1.  In the Application tab of System Debugger, leave the **Project Name**, **Local File Path**, and **Remote File Path** fields empty.
2.  Click the **Debug** button. System debugger shows all processes that are running on the target.
