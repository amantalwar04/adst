# Using the Board Support Package Drivers Page

The **Drivers** page lists all the device drivers assigned for each peripheral in your system. You can select each peripheral and change its default device driver assignment and its version. If you want to remove a driver for a peripheral, assign the driver to **none.**

Some device drivers export parameters that you can configure. If a device in the driver list has parameters, it is listed in navigation pane on the left and you can access them by clicking on the device name.
