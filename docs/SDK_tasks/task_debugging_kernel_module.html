# Debugging a Loadable Kernel Module

To debug a kernel module, set path mapping to map the module name to symbol file of the module. To see loaded modules, select **Kernel** in the **Debug** view, and look at the **Modules** view. Kernel modules are listed by name and not by the file path.

To debug a kernel module:

1.   Select a project in the **Project Explorer** view. 
2.   Select **Run** \> **Debug Configurations** The **Debug Configurations** window appears.
3.   Click the **Path Map** tab to set the path mappings for the selected debug configuration. 
4.   Click **Add** to insert the kernel module. 
5.   Insert a function or line breakpoint and run the core. As soon as the breakpoint is hit, the debug view is updated with all the information. 
6.   Similar to any other process or thread level debugging, you can insert breakpoints, step in, step out, watch variables, stack trace or perform other source level debugging tasks.
