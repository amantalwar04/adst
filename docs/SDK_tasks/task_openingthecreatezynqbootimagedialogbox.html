# Opening the Create Boot Image Dialog Box

1.   Ensure that the FSBL project and C application project are created in the SDK workspace and built so that corresponding ELF files are available. **Note**: For more information, refer to [Creating a New Zynq FSBL Application Project](task_creatinganewzynqfsblapplicationproject.html) and [Creating a Standalone Application Project](sdk_t_create_new_appln.html#). 
2.  Select the application project in the **Project Navigator** or **C/C++ Projects** view and right-click **Create Boot Image.**Alternately, click **Xilinx Tools \> Create Boot Image.**The Create Zynq-7000 AP SoC Boot Image dialog box appears with default values preselected from the context of the selected C project. Note the following: 
    -   When you run Create Boot Image the first time for an application, the dialog box is pre-populated with paths to the selected project ELF file, the FSBL ELF file, and the bitstream for the selected hardware \(if it exists in hardware project\).
    -   If a boot image has previously run for the application, the dialog box is pre-populated with previously used values as per the configuration file present in the project that is in the bif folder.
    -   You can now create boot image for Zynq® and Zynq® UltraScale+™ MPSoC architectures.
    -   You can add new partitions to the boot image by clicking Add and specifying the location of the required data files, if any.
    -   You can now add some information, like version/other info to the boot image. This data will be a part of the Boot header.
        -   The specified data should be a maximum of 76 bytes \(for Zynq\) and 40 bytes \(Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC\).
        -   The specified data will take an offset of 0x4c \(for Zynq\) and 0x70 \(for Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC\) in the bootimage.
    -   Specify offset, alignment, and allocation values for partitions in the boot image, if applicable.
    -   The output file path is set to the bif folder under the selected application project by default.
