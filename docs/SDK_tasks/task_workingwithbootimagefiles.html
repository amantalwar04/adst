# Working with Boot Image Format Files

The utility is driven by a configuration file known as the Boot Image Format \(BIF\) file, with a file extension of \*.bif. The BIF file lists the input files to the boot image, along with optional attributes for addressing and optional encryption, authentication or checksums.

There are two options for working with BIF files:

-   Create a new BIF file: A new BIF file is created at the specified path with the given name. Select this option and use the BIF file path field to specify the location to which SDK will save the BIF file when it is created.
-   Import from an existing BIF file: Specify an existing BIF file to import. SDK populates the fields with the values specified in the BIF file. Select this option and use the BIF file path field to specify the location of the existing BIF file.
