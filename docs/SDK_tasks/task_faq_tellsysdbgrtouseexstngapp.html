# My application already exists in the Linux target. How can I tell system debugger to use my existing application, instead of downloading the application?

1.  In the Application tab of System Debugger, leave the **Project Name** and **Local File Path** fields empty.
2.  In the **Remote File Path** field, specify the remote application path and click the **Debug** button. System debugger loads the specified application.
