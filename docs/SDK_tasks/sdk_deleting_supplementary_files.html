# Deleting Supplementary Files

Supplementary files are by definition trace specific files that accompany a trace. These file could be temporary files, persistent indexes or any other persistent data files created by the tool during parsing a trace.

All supplementary file are hidden from the user and are handled internally by the tool. However, there is a possibility to delete the supplementary files so that there are recreated when opening a trace.

To delete all supplementary files from one or many traces and experiments:

1.   Select the relevant traces and experiments in the **Project Explorer** view. 
2.   Right-click and select **Delete Supplementary Files...** from the context menu that appears. 

    The **Delete Resources** dialog box, with a list of supplementary files, grouped under the trace or experiment they belong to, appears.
