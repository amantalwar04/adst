# Executing a Run Configuration

You can use a run configuration to run a program on a target. You can reuse a previously created run configuration to run your program.

1.  Click **Run \> Run Configurations.**
2.  Select an existing run configuration in the Configurations list.
3.  Click **Run.**
4.  SDK downloads and executes the program on the target. You can view the progress messages on the SDK Console.
5.  To view the program output, use the STDIO Connection tab to use SDK console.
6.  The software program stops upon completion, such as when it reaches the exit\(\) function. If you want to stop the program execution prior to completion, type the command **stop** on the XSCT console.
