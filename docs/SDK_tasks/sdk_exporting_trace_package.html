# Exporting a Trace Package

The **Export Trace Package**wizard allows users to select a trace and export its files and bookmarks to an archive on a media.

The Traces folder holds the set of traces available for a tracing project. To export traces contained in the Traces folder:

1.   Select **File** \> **Export** from the **File** main menu. The **Export** dialog box appears.
2.   Expand **Tracing** and select **Trace Package Export**. 
3.   Click **Next**. The **Export trace package** dialog box appears.

5.   You can also open the **Export trace package**wizard by expanding the project, in the **Project Explorer** view, selecting the traces under the **Traces** folder, and selecting the **Export Trace Package** from the context menu that appears.

    The table below provides details of all the options available on the **Export trace package** dialog box.

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |Content|Lists the files that consititute the trace. The **Trace** item is always selected. The **Supplementary files** items represent the files that are typically generated when a trace is opened by the viewer. Sharing these files can speed up opening a trace dramatically but also increases the size of the exported archive file.|
    |Size|Helps to decide whether or not to include the trace files.|
    |Bookmarks|Select to export all the bookmarks so that they can be shared along with the trace.|
    |To archive file|Specify the location to save the resulting archive.|
    |Options|Allows you to choose between a tar archive or a zip archive. Compression can also be toggled on or off.|

7.   Click **Finish** to generate the package and save it to the media. The folder structure of the selected traces relative to the **Traces** folder is preserved in the trace package.
