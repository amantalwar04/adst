# Enabling Xen Awareness

This section describes setting up the Xen aware debug for Zynq® UltraScale+™ MPSoC devices running Linux from SD card, using the SDK IDE. It is assumed that the following preqequisites have been satisfied:

-   You have PetaLinux Tools software platform ready for building a Linux system customized to your hardware platform.
-   You have created a PetaLinux project from the ZCU102 reference BSP. The Xen related prebuilts are made available in <petalinux-install\>/pre-built/linux/images directory.

For details on how to boot Xen and Dom-0, refer [UG1144 - PetaLinux Tools Documentation: Reference Guide](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest;d=ug1144-petalinux-tools-reference-guide.pdf).

1.   Launch the Xilinx SDK IDE. 
2.   Select **Window** \> **Open Perspective** \> **Debug**. 
3.   Select **Run** \> **Debug Configurations**. 
4.   In the **Debug Configurations** dialog box, select **Xilinx C/C++ application** and click the **New** button \(![](../images/new_icon.png)\). 
5.   Click **Debug**. Debugging begins with the processors in the running state. 
6.   Select the **Enable Linux OS Awareness** option from the **Debug** view in the processor context.

    Xen can be seen as a separate target in the debug view. Domain\#0 is the host OS \(Dom-0\) running on one VCPU \(VCPU\#0\) and Domain\#1 is the guest domain \(Dom-U\) running on one VCPU.
