# Program FPGA Wizard

To select the cable-type and device, connected to the host, using the **Program FPGA** wizard, do the following:

1.   Select **Xilinx tools \> Program FPGA** to launch the **Program FPGA** dialog box. ![](../images/sdk_t_programFPGA_multicable.png) 
2.   Click **Select** to specify appropriate FPGA device among the various FPGA target devices, if there is more than one cable connected to the host. The **Select the device** dialog box appears. ![](../images/sdk_t_programFPGA_selectdevice.png) 
3.   Select a cable and a FPGA device. 
4.   Click **OK**. 
5.   Click **Program** to program FPGA. Alternatively, if there is only one cable connected to the host, you can click **Program** button directly with the default settings to Program FPGA. 

    **Note:** If the Device status is **Auto Detect**, SDK automatically picks up the first cable and the first device from the list.
