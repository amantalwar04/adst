# Using the Board Support Package Settings Driver Configuration Page

The **Driver Configuration** page lists all of the configurable driver parameters for the device selected under the **drivers** entry on the left. To change a parameter, click on the corresponding **Value** field and type the new setting.

When you finish with all the settings you want to make, click **OK** and the SDK re-generates the BSP sources.

If the **Build Automatically** option is selected in the **Project** menu, SDK automatically rebuilds your software platform with your new settings applied.

**Note:** The exact list of software components appearing in the Board Support Package Settings dialog box depends on the components available in your SDK install, as well as the list of components found in any software repositories that are set up in your workspace. For information about how software repositories work, refer to [Repositories](../SDK_concepts/sdk_c_repos.html).
