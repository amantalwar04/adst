# Viewing a Hardware Platform Specification

You can view the hardware platform specification of the hardware system by double-clicking the HDF/XML file under the hardware platform project in the **Project Explorer** view. SDK opens the hardware platform specification viewer, displaying the following overview information about the hardware design:

-   Design information
-   A list of processors in the design, the processor memory map, and the list of peripherals in the processor sub-system
-   A list of IP blocks present in the design.
