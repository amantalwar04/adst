# Building a Board Support Package for SDK

Building a board support package \(BSP\) for application development in SDK involves generating the operating system and libraries constituting the BSP.

You can set the **Build Automatically** option \(which is enabled by default\) to have SDK automatically initiate a build when you create or change your BSP project. Select **Project\> Build Automatically**to enable or disable this capability.

To build a BSP project, right-click the project name and select **Build Project** or **Refresh Project** \(These options appear only if the Build Automatically option is NOT set\). You can also select **Project \> Build Project.**
