# Creating a Linux Application Project

You can create a C or C++ Linux application project by using the **New Application Project** wizard.

To create a project:

1.  Click **File \> New \> Application Project**. The New Application Project dialog box appears. 

    **Note:** This is equivalent to clicking on **File \> New \> Project** to open the New Project wizard, selecting **Xilinx \> Application Project**, and clicking **Next.**

2.  Type a project name into the **Project Name** field.
3.  Select the location for the project. You can use the default location as displayed in the **Location** field by leaving the **Use default location** check box selected. Otherwise, click the check box and type or browse to the directory location.
4.   The **OS Platform** allows you to select which operating system you will be writing code for. Select **Linux**. 

    **Note:** This selection alters what templates you view in the next screen and what supporting code is provided in your project.

5.  From the **Processor** drop-down list, select the processor for which you want to build the application. All supported processor types for Linux applications are listed.
6.   Select an Endianness option: **Little endian** or **Big-endian**. 

    **Note:** This option is enabled only upon selection of the Microblaze processor, from the **Processor** drop-down list.

7.   Select your preferred language: **C**or **C++**. 
8.   Optionally, select **Linux System Root** to specify the Linux sysroot path and select **Linux Toolchain** to specify the Linux toolchain path. 
9.   Click **Next** to advance to the **Templates** screen. 
10. SDK provides useful sample applications listed in **Templates** dialog box that you can use to create your project. The **Description** box displays a brief description of the selected sample application. When you use a sample application for your project, SDK creates the required source and header files and linker script.
11. Select the desired template. If you want to create a blank project, select the**Empty Application.** You can then add C files to the project, after the project is created.
12.  Click **Finish** to create your linux application project.
