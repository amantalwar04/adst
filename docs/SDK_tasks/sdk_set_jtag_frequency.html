# Setting Custom JTAG Frequency

You can now operate at a different frequency supported by the JTAG cable, by setting a custom JTAG frequency.

To set a custom JTAG frquency:

1.   In the **Target Connections** view, click the **Add Target Connection** button.![](../images/sdk_t_target_connections-2.png). The **Target Connection Details** dialog box opens. 
2.   Specify the name of the new remote target connection, for example **test**. 
3.  Check the **Set as default target** checkbox to set this target as default. SDK uses the default target for all the future interactions with the board.
4.   Specify the name or IP address of the remote host machine. This is the machine that is connected to the target and hw\_server is running. 
5.   Specify the port number on which the hw\_server is running. By default, hw\_server runs on port 3121. Select **Use Symbol Server**, if the hardware server is running on a remote host. 
6.   Click **Advanced** to view the JTAG device chain details.

7.   Select the JTAG device chain and click **Frequency** to open the **Set JTAG Frequency** dialog box.

8.   From the **Set custom frequency** drop-down list, select the frequency. 

    **Note:** Current frequency can be the default frequency set by the server or the custom frequency set by a debug client.

9.   Click **OK** to save the configuration and close the **Set JTAG Frequency** dialog box. The selected frequency is saved in the workspace and is used to set the frequency before executing a connect command for the selected device. 
10.  Click **OK** to create a new target connection. 

    **Note:** 

    If only one client is connected to the server, the frequency of the cable will be reset to the default value whenever the connection is closed. However, in case of multiple clients connected to the server, it is not recommended to perform simultaneous debug operations from different clients.
