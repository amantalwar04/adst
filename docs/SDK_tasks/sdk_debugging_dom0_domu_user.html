# Debugging Dom-0/Dom-U User Space Processes

1.   Boot Xen and Dom-0. For details on how to boot Xen and Dom-0, refer [UG1144 - PetaLinux Tools Documentation: Reference Guide](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest;d=ug1144-petalinux-tools-reference-guide.pdf).
2.   Enable Xen awareness by enabling OS aware debug for Xen symbol file. Symbol files are added to a process context to enable source level debugging. For details on how to enable Xen awareness, refer [Enabling Xen Awareness](sdk_enable_xen_aware_debug.html).
3.   Create a Linux application project. For details on how to create a Linux application project, refer [Creating a Linux Application Project](sdk_t_create_new_linux_appln.html).
4.   Configure the Dom-0 user space process by adding the symbol file of the application running on Linux for the debug context of the virtual CPU \(VCPU\#\) of the host domain \(Dom-0\).

5.   Configure Dom-U user space process. 
    1.   Copy the guest Linux images to Dom-0 file system. 
    2.   Create the Lilnux guests with para-virtual networking. 

        ```
            name = "guest 0"
            kernel = "/boot/Image"
            extra = "console=hvc0 rdinit=/sbin/init"
            memory = 256
            vcpus = 2
            vif = [ 'bridge=xenbr0' ]
        ```

    3.   Add the symbol file of the application running on Linux for the debug context of the virtual cpu \(VCPU\#\) of the guest domain \(Dom-U\). 
6.   Once the symbol files are set, you can insert breakpoints, step in, step out, watch variables, stack trace or perform other source level debugging tasks.
