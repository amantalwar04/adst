# Creating a Standalone Application Project

You can create a C or C++ standalone application project by using the **New Application Project** wizard.

To create a project:

1.   Click **File \> New \> Application Project**. The New Application Project dialog box appears. 

    **Note:** This is equivalent to clicking on **File \> New \> Project** to open the New Project wizard, selecting **Xilinx \> Application Project**, and clicking **Next.**

2.   Type a project name into the **Project Name** field. 
3.   Select the location for the project. You can use the default location as displayed in the **Location** field by leaving the **Use default location** check box selected. Otherwise, click the check box and type or browse to the directory location. 
4.   The **OS Platform** allows you to select which operating system you will be writing code for. Select **standalone**. 

    **Note:** This selection alters what templates you view in the next screen and what supporting code is provided in your project.

5.   Select the **Hardware Platform** XML or HDF file, if it was not specified earlier. If you have not build hardware yet, you can select one of the pre-defined platforms from the drop-down. Alternatively, you can drag and drop an existing hardware specification XML/HDF file or search for one by clicking the **New** button and create a new hardware project. After completing the new hardware project creation, you are returned to the **New Application Project** dialog box.
6.   From the **Processor** drop-down list, select the processor for which you want to build the application. This is an important step when there are multiple processors in your design such as any ZynqÂ® PS. 
7.   Select your preferred language: **C**or **C++**. 
8.   Select the compiler: **64-bit** or **32-bit**. 
9.   Select a Board Support Package. You can select to create a new customizable BSP for this application, or you can select an existing BSP. 
10.  Click **Next** to advance to the **Templates** screen. 
11.  SDK provides useful sample applications listed in **Templates** dialog box that you can use to create your project. The **Description** box displays a brief description of the selected sample application. When you use a sample application for your project, SDK creates the required source and header files and linker script. 
12.  Select the desired template. If you want to create a blank project, select the**Empty Application.** You can then add C files to the project, after the project is created. 
13.  Click **Finish** to create your application project and board support package \(if it does not exist\). 

    **Note:** Xilinx recommends that you use Managed Make flow rather than Standard Make C/C++ unless you are comfortable working with make files.
