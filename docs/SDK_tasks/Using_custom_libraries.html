# Using Custom Libraries in Application Projects

You can create custom libraries for common utilities and use them in the application projects. To use the custom libraries in an application project, do the following:

1.   Create a custom library using the **New Library Project** wizard. For more details, refer [Creating a Library Project](sdk_t_create_new_libproj.html). 
2.   Select the project for which you want to include the custom library, in the **Project Explorer** view. 
3.   Select **Project** \> **Properties**. The **Properties for <project\>** window appears. The left panel of the window has a properties list. This list shows the build properties that apply to the current project.
4.   Expand the **C/C++ Build** property. 
5.   Click on **Settings.** 
6.   Under **Tool Settings** tab, expand the **gcc compiler** list. 
7.   Select **Directories** to change the add the library header file path. You can now include the required header files from the library project to the application. 
8.   Expand the **gcc linker** list. 
9.   Select **Libraries** to add the custom library and the library path to the application project.
