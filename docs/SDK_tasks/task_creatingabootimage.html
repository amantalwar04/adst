# Creating a Boot Image

You can create a boot image for for both Zynq® or Zynq® UltraScale+ ™ MPSoC architectures by performing the following instructions:

1.   Make sure that the FSBL project and any C application project are created in the SDK workspace and built so that corresponding ELF files are available. 
2.   Select an architecture for which you plan to create a boot image from the **Architecture** drop down menu. Currently, boot image creation for Zynq and Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC architectures is supported. 
3.   Select **Create a new BIF file**. 
4.   Specify the path for creating a BIF file in **Output BIF file path** . The **Output path** is automatically populated with same path as that of BIF file path. 
5.   Click the **Security** tab if you need secure images. For more details on the settings available on the 
6.   Select **Use Authentication** to enable authentication and select PPK, SPK PSK and SSK values. 
7.   Click the **Encryption** tab. 
8.   Select **Use Encryption** to enable encryption and select the key file and key source. 

    **Note:** SPK signature is not required here, as you will provide the secret key PSK.

9.   Add the partitions one at a time, starting from the bootloader. For details on settings available on the **Add partition** page, refer [Adding a Partition](../SDK_references/refernce_bootimagepartitions.html#adding_boot_partition) 
    1.   Select the Partition type as “bootloader”. 
    2.   Select the FSBL “zynq\_fsbl.elf” path. 
    3.   Select the authentication as rsa and encryption as aes. 
10.  Click **OK**. 

    **Note:** Presign is not required when the secret key SSK is specified.

11.  Click **OK.** 

    Notice that the list in Boot Image Partitions is populated.

12.  Add the second partition. For this example, you will add a C application. 
    1.   Select the Partition type as **datafile.** 
    2.   Select the application **zynq\_hello.elf** path. 
    3.   Select the authentication as **rsa** and encryption as **aes.** 
13.  Click **OK.** 

    Notice that the list in Boot Image Partitions is updated with the second partition.

14.  Click **Create Image** to create the final boot image output.bin.
