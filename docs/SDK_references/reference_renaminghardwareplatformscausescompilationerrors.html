# Renaming hardware platforms causes compilation errors

## Issue

When a hardware specification project is renamed, the dependent BSPs and applications fail to compile.

## Solution

Currently, SDK does not support renaming of hardware specification projects. In order to do so, you must manually change the following items:

-   Change Project References in the BSP project to point to the new hardware project.
-   Change the ELFCheck options in the application's build settings
