# Xilinx SDK Preferences

You can use the **Xilinx SDK** preference page to customize the behavior of the SDK interface.

![](../images/sdk_u_xilinx_pref-1.png)

The table below lists the preferences that can be set using the Xilinx SDK page of the Preferences dialog box.

|Preference|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|Boot Image|The **Boot Image** preference page can be used to set the preferred tool for creating a Zynq boot image. It is set to **bootgen** as the default tool.|
|BSP Preferences|The **BSP Preferences** page can be used to set the level of autonomy as to when the BSP is regenerated and if an alert is listed.|
|Flash Programming|The **Flash Programming** preference page can be used to set the preferences for your Flash Programming downloading. When the Do not show flash device support information before programming check box is selected, SDK disables the alert message about supported Flash devices during Flash programming.|
|Hardware Specification|The **Hardware Specification** preference page can be used to indicate how SDK is to monitor the hardware specification files. By default, SDK always monitors the hardware specification files for changes and will automatically rebuild the necessary projects. Here you may override the default and disable monitoring.|
|Log Information Level|The **Log Information Level** preference page contains the threshold setting of the level of log output from SDK to the console. The Log Level defaults to Info, but can also be set to Trace, Error, or Warning. This information can be used to display activities from SDK as commands are run.|
|Repositories|The **Repositories** preference can be used to add, remove or change the order of software repositories in SDK.|
|SDK Capabilities|The **SDK Capabilities** preference page can be used to enable/disable Xilinx SDK related activities.|
|Toolchain Preferences|The **Toolchain Preferences** preference page can be used to set the default toolchain preferences. **Note:** Preferences will be applicable to new projects only.

The default toolchain for all processors, except MicroBlazeâ„¢ is Linaro. You can now also use the ARMCC toolchain if you have the ARMCC toolchain in the PATH and the license set to use the toolchain. To check if you have ARMCC toolchain in PATH, run**which armcc**in the shell, before launching the Xilinx SDK.

**Note:** ARMCC linker uses the scatter file to read the linker script related data. The scatter file is different from linker script file used in the gcc compilers. Currently Xilinx SDK ships a standard scatter file along with the install, and uses the same scatter file to link all the applications. You have to modify the scatter file created in the application sources, if you need to change the scatter file as per you design.
