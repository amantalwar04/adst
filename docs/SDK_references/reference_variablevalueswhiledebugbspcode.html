# While debugging the BSP code, some variable values are displayed as N/A

## Issue

System Debugger shows some variable values as N/A while debugging the BSP code.

## Solution

When the code is built with optimization level other than `-O0`, some variables are optimized. To view values of such variables, the code should be compiled with `-O0` optimization level. The default optimization level for BSP is `-O2`, which can be changed by appending `-O0` to `extra_compiler_flags` in the BSP settings.
