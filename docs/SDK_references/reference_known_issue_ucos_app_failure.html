# Ucos application project creations fail due to non-availability of pre-compiled libraries and source code

## Issue

Due to the non-availability of pre-compiled libraries and source code for some of the Ucos libraries, for example TcpIP, DHCP and DNS, the application project creation is not successful with Linaro toolchain.

## Solution

Use code sourcery tool chain to build the Ucos projects.
