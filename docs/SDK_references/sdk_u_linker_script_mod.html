# Modifying a Linker Script

Once you generate a linker script, there are multiple ways in which you can update it.

-   Open the linker script using a text editor, and directly edit the linker script. Right-click on the linker script and select **Open With \> Text Editor.**
-   Regenerate the linker script with different settings using the linker script generator.
-   Use the linker script editor to make modifications. To do this, double-click on the linker script. The custom linker script editor displays relevant sections of the linker script.
