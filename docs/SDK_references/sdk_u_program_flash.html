# Program Flash

Program Flash is a SDK tool used to program the flash memories in the design. Various types of flash types are supported by SDK for programming.

-   For Non Zynq devices – Parallel Flash \(BPI\) and Serial Flash \(SPI\) from various makes such as Micron, Spansion.
-   For Zynq Devices – QSPI, NAND & NOR. QSPI can used in different configurations such as QSPI SINGLE, QSPI DUAL PARALLEL, QSPI DUAL STACKED.

The table below lists all the options available on the Program Flash Memory dialog box:

| Option

 | Description

 |
|----------|---------------|
| **Hardware Platform**

 |Select the hardware platform you plan to use.|
| **Connection**

 | Select the connection to hardware server.

 |
| **Device**

 |Select a device. **Auto Detect** selects the first device on the chain, by default.|
|**Image File**| Select the file to write to the flash memory.

 -   Zynq Devices:
    -   Supported file formats for qspi flash types are BIN or MCS formats.
    -   Supported file formats for nor & nand types are only BIN format.
-   Non-Zynq Devices:
    -   Supported types for flash parts in non-zynq devices are BIT, ELF, SREC, MCS, BIN.

 |
|**Offsest**| Specify the offset relative to the Flash Base Address, where the file should be programmed.

 **Note:** Offset is not required for MCS files.

 |
|**FSBL File**|The FSBL `.elf` file is mandatory for the NOR flash types in Zynq devices. **Note:** Not required for non-zynq devices.

|
|**Flash Type**|Select a flash type.-   Zynq devices:
    -   qspi\_single
    -   qspi\_dual\_parallel
    -   qspi\_dual\_stacked
    -   nand\_8
    -   nand\_16
    -   nor
    -   emmc

**Note:** emmc flash type is applicable for Zynq® UltraScale+™ MPSoc devices only.

-   Non-Zynq devices:
    -   The flash type drop down list is populated based on the FPGA detected in the connection. If the connection to hardware server doesn’t exist, error - **Could not retrieve Flash Part information. Please check hardware server connection**, is displayed on the dialog box. Based on the device detected, the dialog populates all the flash parts supported for the device.

**Note:** Appropriate part can be selected based on design. For Xilinx boards the part name can found from the respective boards’ user guide.

|
|**Convert ELF to Bootable SREC format and program**|The ELF file provided as the image file is converted into SREC format and programmed. This is a typical use case in non zynq devices. The SREC bootloader can be built and used to read the SREC converted ELF from flash, load it into RAM and boot.|
|**Blank check after erase**|The blank check is performed to verify if the erase operation was properly done. The contents are read back and check if the region erased is blank.|
|**Verify after flash**| The verify operation is cross check the flash programming operation. The flash contents are read back and cross checked against the programmed data.
