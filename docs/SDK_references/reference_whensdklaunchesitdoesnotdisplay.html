# SDK does not display correct menus, icons or perspective

## Issue

When SDK launches, it does not display the correct menus, the correct icons, or the C/C++ Perspective.

## Solution

SDK is probably reading settings from an outdated .eclipse folder or an outdated workspace. Try opening SDK with a fresh workspace. If that does not work, remove your $HOME/.eclipse folder. \(On NT, this is usually C:\\Documents and settings\\username\\.eclipse.\)
