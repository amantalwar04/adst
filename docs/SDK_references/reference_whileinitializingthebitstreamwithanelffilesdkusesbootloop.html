# While Initializing the bitstream with an ELF file, SDK uses bootloop

## Issue

The Configure FPGA dialog allows you to select the ELF file to be initialized in the bitstream. When this dialog box opens, it remembers the ELF file used in a previous invocation. However, regardless of the ELF shown in the dialog box, SDK always uses bootloop to initialize the bitstream.

## Solution

In the dialog box, manually reselect the ELF to use.
