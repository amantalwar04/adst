# Boot Image Partitions

You can specify the partitions and related information in the Boot Image Partitions area. The partitions list displays the summary of the partitions in the BIF file. It shows the file path, encryption settings, and authentication settings.

Use this area to add, delete, modify, and reorder the partitions. You can also set values for enabling encryption, authentication, and checksum, and specifying some other partition related values like Load, Alignment and Offset.

## Adding a Partition

Click **Add** to add a partition. The table below lists the settings available for both Zynq® and Zynq® UltraScale+ ™ MPSoC architectures :

|Setting

|Description

|
|---------|-------------|
|For Zynq Architecture|
|Partition Type

|Select the partition type:

-   **bootloader** - This specifies the partition is a boot loader like FSBL. This is the first partition in any boot image.
-   **init** - This specifies that the partition is a register initialization file. This is required to set up some register values to access the hardware.
-   **bootimage** - This specifies that partition is an already encrypted or signed partition.
-   **datafile** - This specifies that the partition is a normal partition like an application, bit stream, or u-boot.

 |
|File Path

|The path to the partition file.

|
|Authentication

|Select from the drop down menu, if authentication needs to be made applicable to this partition.

-   rsa: enables rsa authentication for this partition.
-   none: disables the authentication for this partition.

 |
|Encryption

|Select from the drop down menu, if encryption needs to be made applicable to this partition.

-   aes: enables aes encryption for this partition.
-   none: disables the encryption for this partition.

 |
|Checksum

|Select from the drop down menu, if checksum needs to be made applicable to this partition.

md5: enables md5 checksum for this partition.

none: disables the checksum for this partition.

|
|Presign

|When SSK authentication is not given in the main menu, user needs to make sure that presign file, which is nothing but presigned partition signature is specified. This field is enabled only when authentication is enabled.

|
|Alignment

|Sets the byte alignment of the package. Cannot be used with Offset. The partition will be padded to be aligned to a multiple of this value.

|
|Offset

|Sets the absolute offset of the package in the boot image. Cannot be used with Alignment.

|
|Reserve

|Reserves a total amount of memory for this partition. The partition will be padded to this amount.

|
|Load

|Sets the load address for the partition, such as where it will be written to.

|
|Startup

|Sets the entry address for the partition, after it is loaded. This is ignored for partitions that don’t execute.

|
|For Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Architecture|
|Destination CPU

|Sets the processor where the partition should be executing. Supported options are:

 -   A53-0
-   A53-1
-   A53-2
-   A53-3
-   R5-0
-   R5-1
-   R5-lockstep

|
|Destination Device

|Sets the device where the partition will be loaded. Supported options are:

 -   PS
-   PL
-   PMU

## Deleting a Partition

Select any partition and click **Delete** to remove it from the list.

## Editing a Partition

Select any partition and click **Edit** to modify the options for that partition.

## Rearranging Partitions

Select any partition and click **Up** or **Down** to rearrange their order in the partition list.

## Output File

The output file and path name are specified in the Output Path field. This identifies where the output binary image is generated.

Two output formats are supported: \*.bin and \*.mcs . The final boot image format is set based on the extension specified in the output path.
