Next. in the Target Setup tab, set up the following details:

-   **Debug Type**
-   **Connection:** **Local** or **Remote**

Select **Local** for running the program on a target that is connected to local host

Create a remote connection by clicking **New**, and select the same for running the program on a target connected to the remote host.

-   **Device:** This is automatically selected for you.
-   **Hardware Platform** and **Processor:** Select the hardware platform and Processor for your design.
-   **Bitstream file** and **Initialization file:** Search or browses to your Bitstream and Initialization files.
-   **Reset Processor**** **- You can choose to reset the entire hardware system or the specific processor, or choose not to reset. Performing a reset ensures that there are no side effects from a previous debug session.

**Reset Entire System:** Perform a system reset if there is only one processor in the system.

**Reset Processor:** Perform a processor reset if there are multiple processors in the system. SDK downloads the ELF program to the memory before debugging.
