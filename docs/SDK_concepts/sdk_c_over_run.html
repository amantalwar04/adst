# Running Projects

You can run software applications on a hardware target using SDK. The program will run to termination. You can also stop the program at any time of execution. The run workflow is described in the following diagram:

The workflow is made up of the following components:

-   **Executable ELF File**: To debug your application, you must use a compiled Executable and Linkable Format \(ELF\) file. Refer to [Build Configurations](concept_sdk_build_configurations.html) for more information.
-   **Run Configuration**: To launch the run session, you must create a run configuration in SDK. This configuration captures options required to start a run session, including the executable name, processor target to run and other information. Refer to [Launch Configurations](sdk_c_debug_run_configuration.html#) for more information.

You can repeat the cycle of modifying the code, building the executable, and running the program in SDK. The program can be run on all supported debug targets.
