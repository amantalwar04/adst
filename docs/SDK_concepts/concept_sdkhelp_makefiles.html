# Makefiles

Compilation of source files into object files is controlled using Makefiles. With SDK, there are two possible options for Makefiles:

-   **Managed Make**: For Managed Make projects, SDK automatically creates Makefiles. Makefiles created by SDK typically compile the sources into object files, and finally link the different object files into an executable. In most cases, managed make simply eliminates the job of writing Makefiles. This is the suggested option.
-   **Standard Make**: If you want ultimate control over the compilation process, use standard make projects. In this case, you must manually write a Makefile with steps to compile and link an application. Using the Standard Make flow hides a number of dependencies from SDK, so you must follow manual steps for other tasks such as debugging or running the application from within SDK. Therefore, the Standard Make flow is not recommended for general use.
