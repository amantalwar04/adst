# Auto-Synchronizing Software Projects

If you make changes to the hardware in VivadoÂ® and export the specification file or receive one from the hardware developer, SDK automatically detects any change to the contents of the hardware description file referenced by the software projects. It will display the changes to the hardware design, such as additions or deletions of processor and peripheral IP, changes in the memory map of the processor sub-system, or changes in the IP parameters. It also displays and performs the changes to the software projects based on the hardware modification. Some actions are performed by SDK, such as adding or removing drivers in the platform, enabling or disabling projects for a processor, and changing compiler flags. It also provides recommendation of changes that you should perform, such as changing the linker script if the memory map is changed.
