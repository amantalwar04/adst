# Bookmarking an Event

Any event of interest can be tagged with a bookmark.

To add a bookmark, double-click the left margin next to an event, or right-click the margin and select **Add bookmark**. Alternatively use the **Edit** \> **Add bookmark** menu. Edit the bookmark description as desired and click **OK**.

The bookmark will be displayed in the left margin, and hovering the mouse over the bookmark icon will display the description in a tooltip.

The bookmark will be added to the **Bookmarks** view. In this view the bookmark description can be edited, and the bookmark can be deleted. Double-clicking the bookmark or selecting **Go to** from its context menu will open the trace or experiment and go directly to the event that was bookmarked.
