# Board Support Package Settings

Board Support Package is a collection of software drivers and libraries for a hardware platform. By default, a BSP created in SDK includes an OS and drivers for the peripherals in the hardware platform. Some applications may require a BSP with different settings, for example a BSP with flash libraries or modified compiler settings, etc. These can be enabled through Board Support Package Settings.

For more information, refer [Configuring a Board Support Package \(SDK\)](../SDK_tasks/sdk_t_config_bsp_internal.html).
