# FPGA to CPU\(s\) triggering

This is one of the most common use case of cross triggering in Zynq®. There are four trigger inputs on FPGA CTI, which can be configured to halt \(EDBGRQ\) any of the two CPUs. Similarly, the four FPGA CTI trigger outputs can be triggered when a CPU is halted \(DBGACK\). The FPGA trigger inputs and outputs can be connected to ILA cores such that an ILA trigger can halt the CPU\(s\) and the ILA can be triggered to capture the signals it’s monitoring, when any of the two CPUs is halted. For more details about setting up cross trigger to the FTM in Vivado®, refer to the "Cross Trigger Design" section in [Vivado Design Suite Tutorial: Embedded Processor Hardware Design \(UG940\)](http://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=replace;d=ug940-vivado-tutorial-embedded-design.pdf).
