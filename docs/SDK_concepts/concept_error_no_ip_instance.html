# No IP instance named psu\_pcie\_high present in hardware design error in SDK log

## Issue

While opening the 2016.3 or 2016.4 XilinxÂ® SDK workspace with BSP associated with Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC designs, you will see an error in SDK log. You cannot create a new application for the BSP or open an existing BSP.

```
ERROR  : (XSDB Server)ERROR: [Hsi 55-1403]  <path to mss>.mss 
No IP instance named psu_pcie_high present in hardware design
```

## Solution

To fix the issue, open the .mss file in the editor and remove the below lines of code:

```
BEGIN DRIVER
PARAMETER DRIVER_NAME = generic
PARAMETER DRIVER_VER = 2.0
PARAMETER HW_INSTANCE = psu_pcie_high
END
```

Save the file and restart the Xilinx SDK. Create a new BSP file for the same hardware project and change the referenced BSP for all the existing applications to point the newly created BSP.
