-   select a trace element in the **Project Explorer** view and the corresponding **Events** editor will get focus, if the relevant trace is open.
-   select an **Events** editor and the corresponding trace element will be highlighted in the **Project Explorer** view.

To enable or disable this feature toggle the **Link With Editor** button of the**Project Explorer** view as shown below.
