# Debugging Projects

The SDK debugger enables you to see what is happening to a program while it executes. You can set breakpoints or watchpoints to stop the processor, step through program execution, view the program variables and stack, and view the contents of the memory in the system.

The SDK debugger supports debugging through Xilinx System Debugger and GNU Debugger \(GDB\). The Xilinx-customized System Debugger is derived from open-source tools and is integrated with Xilinx SDK.

**Note:** The GDB flow is deprecated and will not be available for future devices.
