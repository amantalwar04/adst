# Setting Up the Software for Profiling

There are three important steps involved in setting up the software application for profiling:

1.  Enable profiling in the Software Platform to include profiling libraries.

    **Note:** Profiling is supported only for standalone software platforms.

    1.  Add -pg to the extra compiler flags to build the BSP with profiling.

    2.  Set enable\_sw\_intrusive\_profiling to true in BSP settings.

2.  Enable profiling in application C/C++ build settings.
