# Searching and Filtering Events

Searching and filtering of events in the table can be performed by entering matching conditions in one or multiple columns in the header row \(the first row below the column header\).

To toggle between searching and filtering, click on the**Search** or **Filter** icon in the header row's left margin, or right-click on the header row and select **Show Filter Bar** or **Show Search Bar** in the context menu.

To apply a matching condition to a specific column, click on the column's header row cell, type in a regular expression and press the ENTER key. You can also enter a simple text string and it will be automatically be replaced with a 'contains' regular expression.

When matching conditions are applied to two or more columns, all conditions must be met for the event to match \(i.e. 'and' behavior\).

To clear all matching conditions in the header row, press the DEL key.
