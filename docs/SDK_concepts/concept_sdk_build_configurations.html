# Build Configurations

Software developers typically build different versions of executables, with different settings used to build those executables. For example, an application that is built for debugging uses a certain set of options \(such as compiler flags and macro definitions\), while the same application is built with a different set of options for eventual release to customers. SDK makes it easier to maintain these different profiles using the concept of build configurations.

A build configuration is a named collection of build tools options. The set of options in a given build configuration causes the build tools to generate a final binary with specific characteristics. When the wizard completes its process, it generates launch configurations with names that follow the pattern <projectname\>, where <projectname\> represents the name of the project.

Each build configuration could customize:

-   Compiler Settings: Debug and Optimization levels
-   Macros passed for compilation
-   Linker Settings

By default, the SDK provides three build configurations, as listed in the table below:

|Configuration Type|Compiler Flags|
|------------------|--------------|
|Debug|`-O0 -g`|
|Release|`-O2`|
|Profile|`-O2 -g -pg`|
