You can configure these libraries to be in or out of your software application stack. For more information, refer [OS and Libraries Document Collection \(UG643\)](http://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest;d=oslib_rm.pdf).

In addition to the above board support packages and component libraries, many third party RTOSes and middleware stacks are available and can be used in the SDK environment to develop applications. For a comprehensive listing of all third party offerings, refer to [http://www.xilinx.com/ise/embedded/epartners/listing.htm](http://www.xilinx.com/ise/embedded/epartners/listing.htm).

Board support packages and their libraries can be configured in various ways in the Board Support Package \(SDK\) Settings dialog box. You can also have multiple board support packages in your SDK workspace. This allows you to simultaneously work with different kinds configurations of board support packages, as well as re-target applications from one to the other.
