# Building Projects

The first step in developing a software application is to create a [Board Support Packages \(SDK\)](sdk_c_bsp_internal.html#) that will be used by the application. Then, you can create an application project.

To build an executable for this application, SDK automatically performs the following actions. Configuration options can also be provided for these steps.

1.  SDK builds the board support package. This is sometimes called a software platform.
2.  SDK compiles the application software using a platform-specific gcc/g++ compiler.
3.  The object files from the application and the Board Support Package are linked together to form the final executable. This step is performed by a linker which takes as input a set of object files and a linker script that specifies where object files should be placed in memory.

The following sections provide an overview of concepts involved in building applications.
