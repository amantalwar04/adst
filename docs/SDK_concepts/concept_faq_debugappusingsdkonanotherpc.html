# I have my board connected on one machine, and I would like to debug my application using SDK running on another machine. How do I set up the Launch Configuration to perform this remote debug operation?

You can do this by specifying the remote machine's access information in the Debug Launch Configuration dialog box. Note that this requires that the Xilinx hw\_server is already running on the remote machine.

1.  Start hw\_server on the remote machine.
2.  In SDK, create a new Target Connection with any name and specify the host name or IP address of the remote machine where hw\_server is running. The default port number used by hw\_server is `3121`.
3.  Check the **Use Symbol Server** checkbox.
4.  In the SDK Debug Configuration dialog box, under the Target Setup tab, select the new connection you just created.**.**
5.  Click **Debug** to start the Remote Debug session.
