# Viewing the Non-Intrusive Profiling Results

Once the application completes execution, or when you click the Stop button to stop the program, XilinxÂ® SDK downloads the non-intrusive profile data and stores it in a file named `gmon.out`.

**Note:** Xilinx SDK automatically opens the `gmon.out` file for viewing. The `gmon.out` file is generated in the debug folder of the application project.
