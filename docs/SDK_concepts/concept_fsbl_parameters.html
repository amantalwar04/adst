# Configure FSBL Parameters

Changing the first stage bootloader \(FSBL\) configuration is only available for the fixed design flow of the System Performance Modeling application.

To invoke the FSBL Configuration Change dialog box, right-click the configuration name and select **Configure FSBL Parameters.**

Below are the details about the first stage bootloader \(FSBL\) parameters.

| Parameter

 | Description

 | Default Value

 |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| PS Clock Frequency \(MHz\)

 | The clock frequency of the Zynq-7000 AP SoC PS \(specified in MHz\).

 | 666.7 MHz

 |
| PL Clock Frequency \(MHz\)

 | The clock frequency of the Zynq-7000 AP SoC PL \(specified in MHz\).

 | 100.0 MHz.

 |
| DDR Clock Frequency \(MHz\)

 | The clock frequency of the DDR memory \(specified in MHz\).

 | 533.3 MHz

 |
| DDR Data Path Width

 | The bit width used in the DDR memory data path. Possible values are 16 and 32 bits.

 | 32 bits

 |
| DDR Port 0 - Enable HPR

 | This enables the usage of high priority reads on DDR port 0. This port is used by the CPUs and the ACP via the L2 Cache.

 | Unchecked

 |
| DDR Port 1 - Enable HPR

 | This enable the usage of high priority reads on DDR port 1. This port is used by other masters via the central interconnect.

 | Unchecked

 |
| DDR Port 2 - Enable HPR

 | This enables the usage of high priority reads on DDR port 2. This port is used by HP2 and HP3.

 | Unchecked

 |
| DDR Port 3 - Enable HPR

 | This enable the usage of high priority reads on DDR port 3. This port is used by HP0 and HP1.

 | Unchecked

 |
| HPR/LPR Queue Partitioning

 | Indicates the desired partitioning for high and low priority reads in the queue. Note that the queue has a depth of 32 read requests. There are four values provided in a drop-down menu.

 | HPR\(0\)/LPR\(32\)

 |
| LPR to Critical Priority Level

 | The number of clocks that the LPR queue can be starved before it goes critical. Unit: 32 DDR clock cycles. This value sets the DDR LPR\_reg register \[1\]. Valid values are between 0 and 2047.

 | 2

 |
| HPR to Critical Priority Level

 | The number of clocks that the HPR queue can be starved before it goes critical. Unit: 32 DDR clock cycles. This value sets the DDR HPR\_reg register \[1\]. Valid values are between 0 and 2047.

 | 15

 |
| Write to Critical Priority Level

 | The number of clocks that the write queue can be starved before it goes critical. Unit: 32 DDR clock cycles. This value sets the DDR WR\_reg register \[1\]. Valid values are between 0 and 2047.

 | 2
