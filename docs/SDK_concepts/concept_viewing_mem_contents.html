# Viewing Memory Contents

The Memory view lets you monitor and modify your process memory. The process memory is presented as a list called memory monitors. Each monitor represents a section of memory specified by its location called base address. Each memory monitor can be displayed in different predefined data formats known as memory renderings.

The Memory view contains these two panes:

-   **Monitors** panel - Displays the list of memory monitors added to the debug session currently selected in the **Debug** view
-   **Renderings** panel - Displays memory renderings. The content of this panel is controlled by the selection in the **Monitors** panel.

To open the **Memory** view, click the **Memory** tab of the **Debug** perspective. Alternatively, from the IDE menu bar, select **Window** \> **Show View** \> **Memory**.
