# Setting Up the Hardware for Profiling

To profile a software application, you must ensure that interrupts are raised periodically to sample the program counter \(PC\) value. To do this, you must program a timer and use the timer interrupt handler to collect and store the PC. The profile interrupt handler requires full access to the timer, so a separate timer that is not used by the application itself must be available in the system.

Xilinx® profiling libraries that provide the profile interrupt handler support the axi\_timer core.

When profiling on Zynq®-7000 AP SoC processors, the internal SCU timer should be used.
