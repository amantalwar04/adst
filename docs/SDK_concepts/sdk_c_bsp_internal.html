# Board Support Packages \(SDK\)

You can create a board support package \(BSP\) for application development within XilinxÂ® SDK, or for use in external tool flows. This topic describes BSPs used within SDK.

A board support package \(BSP\) is a collection of libraries and drivers that will form the lowest layer of your application software stack. Your software applications must link against or run on top of a given software platform using the APIs that it provides. Therefore, before you can create and use software applications in SDK, you must create a board support package.

SDK includes the following two board support packages for application development:

-   **Standalone** - A simple, semi-hosted, and single-threaded environment that provides basic features such as standard input/output and access to processor hardware features
-   **Xilkernel** - A simple and lightweight kernel that provides POSIX style services such as scheduling, threads, synchronization, message passing, and timers

When a board support package is built, the following software components are automatically included into the library:

-   Standard C Libraries \(libc.a, libm.a\)
-   Device Drivers for all the peripherals in your design \(libxil.a\)
