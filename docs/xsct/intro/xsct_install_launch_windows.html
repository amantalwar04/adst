# Installing and Launching XSCT on Windows

XSCT can be installed using the Windows executable installer. The installer executable bears the name Xilinx\_SDK\_<version\>\_Win64.EXE, where <version\> indicates the Xilinx Software Development Kit \(Xilinx SDK\) version number.

**Note:** Installing XSCT on Microsoft Windows operating system might require administrator rights. In addition, your project workspace needs to be set up in any folder that you can fully access.

1.   To install XSCT, double-click the Windows installer executable file. 
2.   The installer accepts your login credentials and allows you to select specific tool components. The client then automatically downloads only what you have selected and installs it on your local machine. 
3.   In the **Select Edition to Install** window, select the **Xilinx Software Command-Line Tool \(XSCT\)** option to install XSCT as a seperate command-line tool only. Alternatively, you can also select the **Xilinx Software Development Kit \(XSDK\)** option to install XSCT as a part of the Xilinx SDK, an Eclipse-based integrated development environment. 
4.   Unless you choose otherwise, XSCT is installed in the C:\\Xilinx directory. 
5.   To launch XSCT on Windows, select **Start** \> **Programs** \> **Xilinx Design Tools** \> **SDK <version\>** and then select **Xilinx Software Command Line Tool**. Where **SDK <version\>** indicates the Xilinx Software Development Kit version number. 
6.   You can also launch XSCT from the command line.
