# mrd

Memory Read

## Syntax

mrd \[options\] <address\> \[num\]

Read `<num>` data values from the active target's memory address specified by `<address>`.

## Options

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|-force|Overwrite access protection. By default accesses to reserved and invalid address ranges are blocked.|
|-size <access-size\>|`<access-size>` can be one of the values below: b = Bytes accesses h = Half-word accesses w = Word accesses d = Double-word accesses Default access size is w Address will be aligned to access-size before reading memory, if '-unaligned-access' option is not used. For targets which do not support double-word access, debugger uses 2 word accesses. If number of data values to be read is more than 1, then debugger selects appropriate access size. For example, 1. mrd -size b 0x0 4 Debugger accesses one word from the memory, displays 4 bytes. 2. mrd -size b 0x0 3 Debugger accesses one half-word and one byte from the memory, displays 3 bytes. 3. mrd 0x0 3 Debugger accesses 3 words from the memory and displays 3 words.|
|-value|Return a Tcl list of values, instead of displaying the result on console.|
|-bin|Return data read from the target in binary format.|
|-file <file-name\>|Write binary data read from the target to `<file-name>`.|
|-address-space <name\>|Access specified memory space instead default memory space of current target. For ARM DAP targets, address spaces DPR, APR and AP`<n>` can be used to access DP Registers, AP Registers and MEM-AP addresses, respectively. For backwards compatibility -arm-dap and -arm-ap options can be used as shorthand for "-address-space APR" and "-address-space AP`<n>`", respectively. The APR address range is 0x0 - 0xfffc, where the higher 8 bits select an AP and lower 8 bits are the register address for that AP.|
|-unaligned-access|Memory address is not aligned to access size, before performing a read operation. Support for unaligned accesses is target architecture dependent. If this option is not specified, addresses are automatically aligned to access size.|

## Note\(s\)

-   Select a APU target to access ARM DAP and MEM-AP address space.

## Returns

Memory addresses and data in requested format, if successful. Error string, if the target memory cannot be read.

## Example\(s\)

```
mrd 0x0
```

Read a word at 0x0.

```
mrd 0x0 10
```

Read 10 words at 0x0.

```
mrd -value 0x0 10
```

Read 10 words at 0x0 and return a Tcl list of values.

```
mrd -size b 0x1 3
```

Read 3 bytes at address 0x1.

```
mrd -size h 0x2 2
```

Read 2 half-words at address 0x2.

```
mrd -bin -file mem.bin 0 100
```

Read 100 words at address 0x0 and write the binary data to mem.bin.

```
mrd -address-space APR 0x100
```

Read APB-AP CSW on Zynq. The higher 8 bits \(0x1\) select the APB-AP and lower 8 bits \(0x0\) is the address of CSW.

```
mrd -address-space APR 0x04
```

Read AHB-AP TAR on Zynq. The higher 8 bits \(0x0\) select the AHB-AP and lower 8 bits \(0x4\) is the address of TAR.

```
mrd -address-space AP1 0x80090088
```

Read address 0x80090088 on DAP APB-AP. 0x80090088 corresponds to DBGDSCR register of Cortex-A9\#0, on Zynq AP 1 selects the APB-AP.

```
mrd -address-space AP0 0xe000d000
```

Read address 0xe000d000 on DAP AHB-AP. 0xe000d000 corresponds to QSPI device on Zynq AP 0 selects the AHB-AP.
