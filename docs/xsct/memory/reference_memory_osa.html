# osa

Configure OS awareness for a symbol file.

## Syntax

osa -file <file-name\> \[options\]

Configure OS awareness for the symbol file `<file-name>` specified. If no symbol file is specifed and only one symbol file exists in target's memory map, then that symbol file is used. If no symbol file is specifed and multiple symbol files exist in target's memory map, then an error is thrown.

|-disable|Disable OS awareness for a symbol file. If this option is not specified, OS awareness is enabled.|
|-fast-exec|Enable fast process start. New processes will not be tracked for debug and are not visible in the debug targets view.|
