# jtag lock

Lock JTAG scan chain.

## Syntax

jtag lock \[timeout\]

Lock JTAG scan chain containing current JTAG target. DESCRIPTION Wait for scan chain lock to be available and then lock it. If `<timeout>` is specified the wait time is limited to `<timeout>` milliseconds. The JTAG lock prevents other clients from performing any JTAG shifts or state changes on the scan chain. Other scan chains can be used in parallel. The jtag run\_sequence command will ensure that all commands in the sequence are performed in order so the use of jtag lock is only needed when multiple jtag run\_sequence commands needs to be done without interruption.

## Note\(s\)

-   A client should avoid locking more than one scan chain since this can cause dead-lock.

## Returns

Nothing.
