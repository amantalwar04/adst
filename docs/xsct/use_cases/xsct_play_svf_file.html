# Generating SVF Files

SVF \(Serial Vector Format\) is an industry standard file format that is used to describe JTAG chain operations in a compact, portable fashion. Below is a example SVF script:

```
# Reset values of respective cores
set core 0
set apu_reset_a53 {0x380e 0x340d 0x2c0b 0x1c07}
# Generate SVF file for linking DAP to the JTAG chain
# Next 2 steps are required only for Rev2.0 silicon and above.
svf config -scan-chain {0x14738093 12 0x5ba00477 4
} -device-index 1 -linkdap -out "dapcon.svf"
svf generate
# Configure the SVF generation
svf config -scan-chain {0x14738093 12 0x5ba00477 4
} -device-index 1 -cpu-index $core -delay 10 -out "fsbl_hello.svf"
# Record writing of bootloop and release of A53 core from reset
svf mwr 0xffff0000 0x14000000
svf mwr 0xfd1a0104 [lindex $apu_reset_a53 $core]
# Record stopping the core
svf stop
# Record downloading FSBL
svf dow "fsbl.elf"
# Record executing FSBL
svf con
svf delay 100000
# Record some delay and then stopping the core
svf stop
# Record downloading the application
svf dow "hello.elf"
# Record executing application
svf con
# Generate SVF
svf generate
```

**Note:** SVF files can only be recorded using XSCT. You can use any standard SVF player to play the SVF file.

To play a SVF file in VivadoÂ® Hardware manager, connect to a target and use the following TCL command to play the file on the selected target.

```
execute_hw_svf <*.svf file>
```
