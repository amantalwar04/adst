# Running an Application in Non-Interactive Mode

Xilinx® System Debugger Command-line Interface \(XSDB\) provides a scriptable interface to run applications in non-interactive mode. To run the program in previous example using a script, create a tcl script \(and name it as, for example, test.tcl\) with the following commands. The script can be run by passing it as a launch argument to xsdb.

```
connect -url TCP:xhdbfarmc7:3121

# Select the target whose name starts with ARM and ends with #0. 
# On Zynq, this selects “ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore #0”

targets -set -filter {name =~ "ARM* #0"}

# Set a breakpoint at exit
