# Switching Between XSCT and Xilinx SDK Development Environment

Below is an example XSCT session that demonstrates creating two applications using XSCT and modifying the BSP settings. After the execution, launch the Xilinx® SDK development environment and select the workspace created using XSCT, to view the updates.

**Note:** The workspace created in XSCT can be used from Xilinx SDK. However, at a time, only one instance of the tool can use the workspace.

```
setws /tmp/wrk/workspace
createhw –name hw0 –hwspec /tmp/wrk/system.hdf
createbsp -name bsp0 -proc ps7_cortexa9_0 -hwproject hw0 -os standalone
createapp -name hello0 -app {Hello World} -proc ps7_cortexa9_0 -hwproject hw0 -bsp bsp0 -os standalone
createapp -name fsbl0 -app {Zynq FSBL} -proc ps7_cortexa9_0 -hwproject hw0 -bsp bsp0 -os standalone
projects –build 
```
