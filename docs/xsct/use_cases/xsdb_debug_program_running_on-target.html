# Debugging a Program Already Running on the Target

XilinxÂ® System Debugger Command-line Interface \(XSDB\) can be used to debug a program which is already running on the target \(for example, booting from flash\). Users will need to connect to the target and set the symbol file for the program running on the target. This method can also be used to debug Linux kernel booting from flash. For best results, the code running on the target should be compiled with debug info.

Below is an example of debugging a program already running on the target. For demo purpose, the program has been stopped at main\(\), before this example session.

```
# Connect to hw_server

xsdb% conn -url TCP:xhdbfarmc7:3121
tcfchan#0
xsdb% Info: ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore #0 (target 2) Stopped at 0x1005a4 (Hardware Breakpoint)
xsdb% Info: ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore #1 (target 3) Stopped at 0xfffffe18 (Suspended)

# Select the target on which the program is running and specify the symbol file using the 
# memmap command

xsdb% targets 2
xsdb% memmap -file dhrystone/Debug/dhrystone.elf

# Once the symbol file is specified, the debugger maps the code on the target to the symbol 
# file. bt command can be used to see the back trace. Further debug is possible, as shown in 
# the first example

xsdb% bt
    0  0x1005a4 main(): ../src/dhry_1.c, line 79
    1  0x1022d8 _start()+88
    2  unknown-pc
```
