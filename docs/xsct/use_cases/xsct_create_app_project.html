# Creating an Application Project Using an Application Template

Below is an example XSCT session that demonstrates creating a FSBL project for an Cortex® - A53 processor.

**Note:** Creating an application project will create a BSP project by adding the necessary libraries. FSBL\_DEBUG\_DETAILED symbol is added to FSBL for debug messages.

```
setws /tmp/wrk/workspace
createhw –name hw0 –hwspec /tmp/wrk/system.hdf
createapp –name fsbl1 –app {Zynq MP FSBL} –proc psu_cortexa53_0 –hwproject hw0 –os standalone
configapp –app fsbl1 define-compiler-symbols FSBL_DEBUG_DETAILED
projects –build 
```
