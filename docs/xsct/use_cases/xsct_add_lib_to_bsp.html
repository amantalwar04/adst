# Working with Libraries

Below is an example XSCT session that demonstrates creating a normal BSP and add XILFFS & XILRSA libraries to the BSP. Create a FSBL application thereafter.

**Note:** Normal BSP do not contain any libraries.

```
setws /tmp/wrk/workspace
createhw –name hw0 –hwspec /tmp/wrk/system.hdf
createbsp -name bsp0 -proc ps7_cortexa9_0 -hwproject hw0 -os standalone
setlib -bsp bsp0 -lib xilffs
setlib -bsp bsp0 -lib xilrsa
updatemss -mss bsp0/system.mss
regenbsp -bsp bsp0
createapp -name fsbl0 -app {Zynq FSBL} -proc ps7_cortexa9_0 -bsp bsp0 -hwproject hw0 -os standalone
projects –build
```

Changing the OS version.

```
setosversion -bsp bsp0 -ver 5.2
```

Assigning a driver to an IP.

```
setdriver -bsp bsp0 -ip ps7_uart_1 -driver generic
```

Removing a library \(removes xilrsa library from BSP\).

```
removelib -bsp hello_bsp -lib xilrsa
```
